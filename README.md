•Implementation of an Asynchronous FIFO (First In First Out) using Verilog HDL

– Designed and implemented an Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory module in Verilog, featuring robust pointer
handling and synchronization across different clock domains.
– Utilized a testbench for thorough validation, ensuring reliable data transfer and management within digital systems.
